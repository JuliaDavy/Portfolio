        <p>Hi! I'm a UX/UI Researcher and Designer based in Spain.</p2> 
          <p>I'm passionate about improving the lives of others through design and am constantly looking to learn new things everyday.</p2>
            <h2>My values</h2>
            



<ul>
  <li><h4>😍 Passion is everything</li></h4>
  <p>If you don't enjoy what you're doing - move. <p>You are not a tree.</p> Channel your energy into something you believe in. I'm fortunate to be inspired and surrounded by motivated people who enjoy what they do.</p> <p>We only have so much time on this earth to live - so why waste it?
  </p>

  <li><h4>🤓 Always be learning</li></h4>
  <p>Humans are constant works in progress that need to receive feedback in order to grow.</p> <p>I am always looking at ways to challenge and improve myself, which is why in my spare time I like to participate in hackathons, read blogs, dabble in new projects and attend meetups.
  </p>

  <li><h4>🎨 Embrace your creativity</li></h4>
  <p>Everyone needs a creative outlet of some sort - else, we'd go insane!</p> When I'm not designing, I'm singing with the band, painting artworks as a form of meditation and helping startups realise their potential with design.
  </p>

  <li><h4>🙏 Stay humble</li></h4>
  <p>It doesn't matter whether you're the president, manager, homeless or average kid on the street.</p><p> Treat others with respect as you would yourself because ultimately we're all human sharing the same wants and needs and facing our own battles everyday.</p> Stay true to yourself and stay true to others.</p2>
  </p>

</ul>
